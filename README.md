# Image Quality Evaluator

**An API for scoring and evaluating photo quality using CLIP image embeddings and a custom-trained LightGBM regression model.**

This project predicts perceived image quality using visual embeddings and regression, supporting use cases like profile photo optimization, content curation, and image ranking.

## üîç How It Works

1. Extracts **CLIP-L/14** image embeddings to represent the photo semantically.
2. Feeds embeddings into a **LightGBM regression model** trained on real-world visual aesthetics scores.
3. Returns a **numeric score (1‚Äì10)** reflecting predicted image quality.
4. (Coming soon) Integration with **GPT-4 Vision** to generate feedback and improvement suggestions.

## üß† Model Training Process

The regression model was trained on a dataset of facial images labeled with **perceived image quality scores**, using a pipeline designed for performance and generalization:

- **Data Collection**: Curated labeled datasets containing human-scored facial images
- **GPU Embedding Generation**: Extracted CLIP-L/14 image embeddings in batches using RunPod cloud GPUs for efficient processing, avoiding CPU bottlenecks
- **Label Normalization**: Scaled quality scores to a 0‚Äì1 range using `MinMaxScaler` to improve training stability
- **Oversampling Extremes**: Duplicated samples from high (‚â•8.5) and low (‚â§2.5) quality ranges to correct label imbalance
- **Sample Weighting**: Assigned higher training weights to extreme-score samples to emphasize their influence during optimization
- **Error-Focused Tuning**: Used bin-level prediction analysis (low/mid/high/top) to guide sampling strategy and reduce drift across score categories

The final LightGBM model achieved **R¬≤ = 0.90** and **RMSE ‚âà 0.56** on validation data, indicating strong predictive performance across the full quality spectrum.
